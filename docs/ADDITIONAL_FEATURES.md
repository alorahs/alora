## Routes Added

1. `/profile/edit` - User profile editing page
2. `/profile/booking/:id` - Booking details page
3. `/professional/dashboard` - Professional dashboard (professional users only)

## Integration Points

### Profile Page Updates
- Added "Edit Profile" button linking to the profile editing page
- Added "Dashboard" button for professionals linking to their dashboard
- Improved layout with better button organization

### Dashboard Updates
- Added "View Details" button on each booking card linking to the booking details page
- Improved button organization with better spacing

## Technical Implementation

### API Integration
All new features properly integrate with the backend API:
- Use of `API_URL` constant from auth provider
- Proper authentication with `credentials: "include"`
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Loading states for better UX
- Success notifications using toast components

### Security Considerations
- Proper role-based access control (professional dashboard only accessible to professionals)
- Authentication required for all API calls
- Sensitive fields protected from client-side updates (password, email, role)

### User Experience
- Consistent design with existing application
- Responsive layouts for all screen sizes
- Clear navigation paths
- Informative error messages
- Loading indicators during API calls

## Backend Endpoints Utilized

- `PUT /user` - Update user profile (implemented in profile editing)

### Booking Management
- `GET /booking/{id}` - Get specific booking details (implemented in booking details)
- `GET /booking/professional/{professionalId}` - Get bookings for professional (implemented in professional dashboard)
