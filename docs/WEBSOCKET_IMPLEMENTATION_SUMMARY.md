   - Connection status checking

### Configuration Files

1. **`package.json`** - Modified to:
   - Add a new development script for WebSocket testing

### Documentation Files

1. **`WEBSOCKET_INTEGRATION.md`** - New file containing:
   - Comprehensive guide for using WebSocket functionality
   - Examples and best practices
   - Troubleshooting tips

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Connection Management
- Connects automatically when user logs in
- Disconnects when user logs out
- Handles reconnection attempts
- Uses same JWT authentication as REST API

### 2. Real-time Notification Integration
- Automatically refreshes notification list when new notifications arrive
- Shows toast notifications for immediate user feedback
- Works seamlessly with existing notification context

### 3. Event System
- Predefined events for common use cases
- Custom event emission capability
- Error handling and connection status monitoring

### 4. User Presence Tracking
- Tracks online/offline status of users
- Broadcasts presence events to other users

### 5. Visual Feedback
- Connection status indicator
- Demo component for testing
- Toast notifications for events

## How It Works

### Connection Flow
1. User logs in through AuthProvider
2. WebSocketProvider detects authenticated user
3. Extracts JWT token from cookies
4. Connects to Socket.IO server with authentication
5. Registers user with server
6. Listens for real-time events

### Notification Integration
1. Server emits `newNotification` event
2. Client receives event in WebSocketProvider
3. Triggers refresh of notification context
4. Shows toast notification to user

### Event Handling
1. Components use `useWebSocketHook` to access socket functionality
2. Hook provides helper functions for common events
3. Custom events can be emitted using the `emit` function
4. Connection status is available through the hook

## Using the Implementation

### In Components
```typescript
import { useWebSocketHook } from "@/hooks/useWebSocket";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { isConnected, emit } = useWebSocketHook();
  
  const sendMessage = () => {
    emit("customEvent", { message: "Hello server!" });
  };
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>WebSocket Status: {isConnected ? "Connected" : "Disconnected"}</p>
      <button onClick={sendMessage} disabled={!isConnected}>
        Send Message
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Pre-built Functions
```typescript
import { useWebSocketHook } from "@/hooks/useWebSocket";

const { 
  isConnected, 
  sendTyping, 
  updateStatus, 
  sendBookingUpdate 
} = useWebSocketHook();
```

## Available Events

### Incoming Events (Server to Client)
- `newNotification` - New notification received
- `userOnline` - A user has come online
- `userOffline` - A user has gone offline
- `statusUpdated` - User status has been updated
- `userTyping` - User is typing (for chat features)
- `bookingUpdated` - Booking status has changed

### Outgoing Events (Client to Server)
- `register` - Register user with their socket ID (automatic)
- `typing` - Indicate user is typing
- `updateStatus` - Update user status
- `bookingUpdate` - Send booking update

## Testing the Implementation

### Visual Testing
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Log in to the application
3. Observe the "Live" indicator in the bottom right corner
4. Trigger a notification through the backend
5. Verify that the notification appears immediately

### Using the Demo Component
1. Import and use the `WebSocketDemo` component
2. Test different event types
3. Check browser console for event logs

## Security Features

- Uses same JWT authentication as REST API
- Secure token extraction from HTTP-only cookies
- Proper CORS configuration
- Connection validation

## Performance Considerations

- Only connects for authenticated users
- Automatic cleanup on logout
- Efficient event handling
- Minimal overhead when disconnected

## Future Enhancements

1. **Room-based messaging** - For group chat features
2. **Message history** - For offline message queuing
3. **Connection optimization** - For mobile networks
4. **Advanced error handling** - For specific network conditions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Not connecting**: Verify JWT token validity
2. **Events not received**: Check user registration
3. **Connection drops**: Check network connectivity
4. **Authentication errors**: Verify token extraction

### Debugging Tips
1. Check browser console for connection logs
2. Verify token is present in cookies
3. Check network tab for WebSocket frames
4. Confirm server is running and accessible

## Integration with Existing Features

The WebSocket implementation is designed to work seamlessly with:
- Authentication system
- Notification system
- User management
- Booking system

When real-time events occur on the server (such as new bookings or status changes), users will automatically receive notifications without needing to refresh the page.
